## Project Summary
We impolement a reinforcement learning agent to play Mini Metro in a custom simulation environment. The evironment exposes a Gym-like API to help the agent to oberve the transit system state and choose high level network edit actions from the custom game engine. The goal is to learn a control policy that keeps the system stable for as long as possible while minimizing passenger waiting and station overcrowding. Eventually maximize the surviving time and handling increasing demand wihtout failture.
